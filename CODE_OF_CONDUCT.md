# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

***TLDR:** Don't be a donkey and chill.*

## Our Pledge

In the interest of being welcoming, contributors and maintainers pledge to act with common sense and reserve expletives to ourselves.

## Our Standards

Examples of encouraged behavior:

-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Considering constructive criticism
-   Showing empathy towards others
-   Adapting to the social behavior of others to a reasonable degree

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   Insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the appropriate channel(s). The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
